# Provenance Graph

This folder contains the [provenance graph](./provenance-graph.xml) from the execution of a quantum circuit implementing a quantum full adder using the PROV XML serialization.
The base quantum circuit for the full adder can be found [here](./circuits/adder.py).
Furthermore, the initialized quantum circuit for the input data a=1, b=1, and carry=1 is available [here](./circuits/adder-initialized.py).

Below a graphical representation of the provenance graph generated by the [ProvToolbox](https://github.com/lucmoreau/ProvToolbox) is displayed:
