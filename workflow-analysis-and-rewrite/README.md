# Workflow Analysis and Rewrite for Hybrid Runtimes

This folder contains collected provenance data for the analysis and rewrite of quantum workflows to improve their efficiency using hybrid runtimes.

It comprises two sub-folders:

* [2022-closer](./2022-closer): 
    * Evaluation of the performance of the analysis and rewrite method
    * Small comparison of the runtime of original and rewriten workflows
    
* [2022-sncs](./2022-sncs):
    * Extended evaluation of the analysis and rewrite method
    * Runtime comparison for multiple workflow models and hybrid runtimes
    * Evaluation of the overhead when collecting provenance data from hybrid runtimes while executing hybrid programs
