# Workflow Analysis and Rewrite

This folder contains the provenance data collected for the analysis and rewrite method for quantum workflows to benefit from hybrid runtimes presented [here](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/tree/master/2022-closer).

It comprises the following data:
    * measurements of the time required to analyse and rewrite quantum workflows 
        ** [runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.xlxs](./runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.xlxs)
        ** [runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.csv](./runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.csv)
    * runtime comparison of a workflow model comprising hybrid algorithms before and after rewriting
        ** [runtime-comparison-workflow.xlxs](./runtime-comparison-workflow.xlxs)
        ** [runtime-comparison-workflow.csv](./runtime-comparison-workflow.csv)
