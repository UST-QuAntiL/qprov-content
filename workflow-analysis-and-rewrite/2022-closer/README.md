# Workflow Analysis and Rewrite - CLOSER 2022

This folder contains the provenance data collected for the analysis and rewrite method for quantum workflows to benefit from hybrid runtimes presented [here](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/tree/master/2022-closer).

It comprises the following data:

* measurements of the time required to analyse and rewrite quantum workflows 
    * [runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.xlsx](./runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.xlsx)
    * [runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.csv](./runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.csv)

* runtime comparison of a workflow model comprising hybrid algorithms before and after rewriting
    * [runtime-comparison-workflow.xlsx](./runtime-comparison-workflow.xlsx)
    * [runtime-comparison-workflow.csv](./runtime-comparison-workflow.csv)
