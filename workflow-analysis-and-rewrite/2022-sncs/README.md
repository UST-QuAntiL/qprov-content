# Provenance-Preserving Workflow Analysis and Rewrite - Springer Nature Computer Science 2022

This folder contains the raw data for the evaluation part of the paper entitled "Provenance-Preserving Analysis and Rewrite of Quantum Workflows for Hybrid Quantum Algorithms".
A corresponding use case showcasing how to set up the prototype and apply the method to an example workflow can be found [here](https://github.com/UST-QuAntiL/QuantME-UseCases/tree/master/2022-sncs).

It comprises the following data:

* measurements of the time required to analyze and rewrite various quantum workflows
    * [runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.xlsx](./runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.xlsx)
    * [runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.csv](./runtime-analysis-and-rewrite.csv)

* runtime comparison of four workflow models comprising hybrid algorithms before and after rewriting using quantum computers from IBM and Qiskit Runtime
    * [workflow-runtime-comparison-IBMQ.xlsx](./workflow-runtime-comparison-IBMQ.xlsx)
    * [workflow-runtime-comparison-IBMQ.csv](./workflow-runtime-comparison-IBMQ.csv)

* runtime comparison of one workflow model comprising hybrid algorithms before and after rewriting using quantum computers from AWS and AWS Braket Hybrid Jobs
    * [workflow-runtime-comparison-AWS.xlsx](./workflow-runtime-comparison-AWS.xlsx)
    * [workflow-runtime-comparison-AWS.csv](./workflow-runtime-comparison-AWS.csv)
